Hi, I am an incoming PhD student at the University of Oxford under the [Intelligent Earth CDT program](https://intelligent-earth.ox.ac.uk/home).
I am interested in geometric and topological machine learning, especially their application to natural sciences.
During my PhD, I would like to dive deeper into the intersection of AI and physics, not only to model complex physical processes, but also
to understand how these models encode phsyical laws (which utlimately may provide insights into improving the modelling aspect).
